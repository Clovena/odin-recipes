    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a delicious twist on a classic sourdough recipe.<br />
      Enjoy with butter or <strong>your favorite jams!</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>100 grams sourdough starter, active and bubbly</li>
      <li>325 grams water</li>
      <li>475 grams all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>10 grams salt</li>
      <li>3/4 block cream cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup blueberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix the starter, water, flour, and salt together and let sit for 30
        minutes to allow the flour to hydrate. Stretch and fold the mix every 30
        minutes for 2 hours (a total of four folds).
      </li>
      <li>
        Let sit on counter with a damp tea cloth, or use a pan lid that fits the
        bowl, for 12 hours or until doubled in size. Once doubled in size, roll
        out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 3/4 block of cream cheese (cubed) and about a cup of blueberries.
        Fold each side over the additives and roll towards you. Make sure to
        roll tightly so the additives won't fall out of the bottom. Put bowl in
        plastic sack, tie, and stick in fridge for 8-12 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 450Â°. Pull dough out of refrigerator and score however
        you choose. Bake in Dutch oven with lid on for 35 minutes. Remove lid
        and continue baking for 20-25 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
