    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a breakfast bake made with cottage cheese and blueberries.<br />
      <em>Perfect</em> for cozy weekend mornings!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup cottage cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup rolled oats</li>
      <li>1/2 cup fresh blueberries</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/4 cup honey or maple syrup</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Set your oven to 350F (175C) and grease a small baking dish.</li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine cottage cheese, rolled oats, eggs, honey (or
        maple syrup), cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Stir until everything is
        well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently fold in the fresh blueberries to ensure they're evenly
        distributed throughout the batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the mixture into the greased baking dish and spread it evenly. Bake
        for 25-30 minutes or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick
        inserted in the center comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the bake to cool slightly before slicing. Enjoy it warm, or store
        leftovers in the refrigerator for a quick grab-and-go breakfast
        throughout the week.
      </li>
    </ol>
