# Odin Recipes

I am working through the Foundations course in The Odin Project. This is my first public repo on Github. So far, I've enjoyed a refresher course on using CLI to navigate through filepaths and interact with files. Additionally, TOP's Foundations course has provided a strong reinforcement on my knowledge of Git. 

I am looking forward to learning and practicing HTML and CSS, to begin. I've tried a couple online courses but have not had great success in practice. I'm hoping that TOP's approach will help me reinforce the skills I'm learning and allow me to develop on the web in a more meaningful way.
